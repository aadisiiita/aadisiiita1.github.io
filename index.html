<h1>About Earth</h1>
</div>
<p><div class="my1">Regarding good, people are the ultimate source of it. Every single human being is completely different with their own flaws, skills, experiences, secrets, and dreams. Every man and woman hold inside them a story so infinitely interesting that it could never be told completely in a film, book or conversation. People cannot be defined as ignorant, pretty, selfish, purple, happy or conservative. Every person is a unique being shaped by the infinite amount of variables that our Earth-bound existences offer us. The Earth is a museum, and we all are the art within it. Study all of the art regardless of its shape, color or texture, and you will gain a greater understanding of the museum.</div>

<div class="my2">Life is what you make of it. Life is perception: sight, taste, smell, sound, and touch. Reality depends upon the intensity and angle with which light hits our eyes. Reality sounds only because of the way our brains decipher the vibrations of the air around us. That same air is only felt because of the stimulation of our nerve endings and the subsequent signals to our brains. We are only told what is around us; it is our job actually to interpret that information. A “negative” sensory input can be a source of anguish, or simply an inspiration to change everything and attract more positive inputs. It is up to you, and you alone. No one thing or one person can decide or influence how you feel. That is completely up to you. Decide to be happy about life, and you will remain that way. It is your perception, so why not make it a positive perception?</div></p>
